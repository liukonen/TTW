MSCS Text Translation wrapper


This is a wrapper DLL for Microsoft's new Cognitive Services API, when working with the text translation service. 

How to use.
In the constructor of the object you will need to pass in the key value that MS gives you on there translation service. The translate call takes in the text, the from language, which is the language that the text is currently in, and a to language, which is what the output language that Microsoft will translate to.

Im sure that a future version of VS will make binding to there Cognitive services much easier, like they did web services... but until they do, we have this :)
